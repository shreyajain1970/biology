    <h1 style="color: rgb(79, 195, 238);">macromolecules</h1><hr>
    <p1>four important class of biological molecules are:
        <dl>
            <dt>Carbohydrates:</dt>
            <dd>They are source of enrgy and provide structural supoort.</dd>
            <dt>Proteins:</dt>
            <dd>have wide range of functions, such as catalyzing reactions and transporting substances into and out of cells.</dd>
            <dt>Nucleic acids:</dt>
            <dd>store genetic information and function in gene expression.</dd>
            <dt>lipids:</dt>
            <dd >provide energy,make cell membrane and act as hormones.<br>
             <p style="color: red;">note: lipids are not polymers or macromolecules. they are a groupo of diverse molecules that do not mix well with water</p></dd>
        </dl>
    </p1>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(79, 195, 238);">Macromolecules are polymers</h3><hr>
    Large Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Nucleic acids also known as macromoleculesfor their huge sixe are chain like molecules called polymers.Small repeating units are called monomers.
    <h5>The synthesis and breakdown of polymers</h5>
    the reaction that connects monmer to another monomer or a polymer is called a condensation reaction.<br>if a water molecule is lost in the reaction, it is known as dehydration reaction.Carbohydrates and protein polymers are formed by dehydration reaction.
    <br>reverse of dehydration is hyidrolysis. it means water breakage.The bond between monomers are broken by adding a water molecule. Digestion is occured through hydrolysis.
    <h3 style="color: rgb(79, 195, 238);">lipids</h3><hr>
    <ul><li> They are not plymers or macromolecules.</li>
        <li>They are grouped together as they are hydrophobic.</li>
        <li>They consists mainly of hydrocarbon region with relatively non polar ch bonds.</li>
        <li>We will focus on three types of lipids:
            <ol>
                <li>fats</li>
                <li>phospholipids</li>
                <li>steroids</li>
            </ol> 
        </li>
     </ul>
     <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"><u>Fats /triacylglycerol /triglyceride</u></h5>
     <ul>
        <li>fats are not polymers.</li>
        <li>They are large molecules assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions</li>
        <li>They consists of a glycerol molecule joined to three fatty acids.</li>
        <li>a fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 corbon in length.</li>
        <li>Fats saperate from water because the water molecules hydrogen bond to one another and exclude the fats.</li>
        <li>the completed fat consists of three fatty acids linkes to ine glycerol molecule.</li>
        <li>The fatty acids in a fat can be same or they can ve two or three different kinds.</li>
        <li>the saturated and unsaturated are used for hydrocarbon chain. saturated fatty acids have no cc double bond but unsaturated fatty acids have one or more cc double bonds.</li>
        <li>usually, fatty acids are cis double bonds which creates a kink in the hydrocarbon chain.</li>
        <li>Most animal fats are saturated. Lack of double bonds and flexibity allows them to pask tightly. Thus they are solid at room temp.</li>
        <li>fats of plants and fishes are generally unsaturated and are referred to as oils.</li>
        <li>The term saturated vegetable oil means the unsaturated fats are sythetically conveted to saturated fats by adding hydrogen.</li>
        <li>The deit rich in saturated fats is one of the several factors that may contribute to the cardiovascular disease known as atheroscelrosis.</li>
        <li>The process of hydrogenating vegetable oils produces not only saturated fats but also unsaturated fats with trans double bonds.</li>
        <li>trans fats can contribute to cotonary heart disease. trans fats are especially common in baked goods and processed foods.</li>
        <li>The major function of fats is energy storage.</li>
        <li>The hydrocarbon chain of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and just as rich in energy.</li>
        <li>A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide such as starch.</li>
        <li>Humans and other mammals stock their long term reserve in adipose cells ehich swell and shrind as fat is deposited and withdrown from storage. They also cushions such vital organs as the kidneys and a layer of fat beneath the skin insulated the body. this subcutaneous layer is especially thick in whales, seals, and most mammals, insulating their bodies in cold ocean water</li>
     </ul>
     <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"><u>phospholipids</u></h5>
     <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
     <li>They are major constituents of cell membrane.</li>
     <li>a phospholipid is similar to a fat molicule baus has only two fatty acids attached to glycerol rather than three.</li>
     <li>The third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group, which has a negative electrical charge in the cell. </li>
     <li>typically, an additional small charged or polar molecule is also linked to the phosphate group. Choline is one such molecule.</li>
     <li>the two ends of phospholipids show different behaviors:
        <dl><dt>hydrocarbon tail:</dt>
        <dd>They are hydrophobic and are excluded by water.</dd>
        <dt>Phosphate group:</dt>
        <dd>They are hydrophilic head which has affinity for water.</dd></dl>
        <br>
        When phospholipid are added to water, they self assemble into a double layered sheet called a bilayer that shields their hydrophobic fatty acid tails from water.
     </li>
     <li>Surface of the cell is also arranged in similar bilayer.</li>
     <li style="color: red;">NOTE: The existence of cells depends on the proteins of phospholipids.</li></ul>
     <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Steroids</h5>
     <ul>
        <li>steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings</li>
        <li>cholestrol is a crucial steroid in animals</li>
        <li>its a common component of animal cell membrane</li>
        <li>it synthesyze other steroids such as the vertebrate sex hormone</li>
        <li>in vertebrates, cholestrol is sythesized in liver and iss also obtained by diet.</li>
        <li>a high cholestrol level in blood may lead to atherosclerosis</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 style="color: rgb(79, 195, 238);">Carbohydrates</h3>
     <ul><li>They serve as fuel and building material.</li>
     <li>Carbohydrates include sugars and polymers of sugars</li>
    <li>simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides</li>
    <li>these are the monomers from which more complex carbohydrates are built.</li>
    <li>disaccharides are double sugars, consisting of two monosacccharides joined by a covalent bond.</li></ul>
    <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Sugars</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>monosacccharides generally have molecular formulas that are some multiple of the unit CH<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
        <li>Glucose is the most common monosacchaaride.</li>
        <li>a monosaccharide can be aldose or ketose</li>
        <li>monosaccharides can also be classified by the size of carbon skeleton which ranges from 3 to 7 carbon long.</li>
        <li>monosaccharides having 6 carbons are called hexos. Trios and pentoses are also common</li>
        <li>in aquous solution, 5 or 6 carbon sugars form rings because they are the most stable form of these sugars under physiological conditions</li>
        <li> Monosaccharides particularly glucose are major nutrients for cells.</li>
        <li>Monosaccharides that are not immediately used are generally incorperated as monomers.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>a disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage</li>
        <li>a glycosidic linkage is a covalent cond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehysration reaction</li>
        <li>Plants generally transport carbohydrates from leaves to roots and other non photosynthetic organs in the form of sucrose </li>
        <li>Disaccharides must be broken down into monosaccharides to be used for energy by organisms.</li>
        <li>lactose intolerance is a connom condition in gunams who lack lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose</li>
        <li>The sugar is instead broken down by intestinal bacteria, causing formation of gas and subsequent cramping.</li>
        <li>The problem may be avoided by taking the enzyme lactase when eating or drinking dairy products or consuming diary products tat have alredy been treated with lactase to break down the lactose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Polysaccharides</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Polysaccharides are macromolecules, polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages</li>
        <li>some serve as storage material, hydrolysed as needed to provide monosaccgarides for cells</li>
        <li>some serve as building material for structures that protect the cell.</li>
        <li>The architecture and function of a polysaccharide are determined by its monosaccharides and by the positions of its glycosidic linkages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h7>Storage polysaccharides:</h7>
    <ul>
        <li> Both plants and animals store sugars for later use in the form of storage palysaccharides </li>
        <li>Plants store starch, a polymer of glucose monomers</li>
        <li>synthesizing starch enables the plant to stockpile surplus glucose.</li>
        <li>Most animals, including humans, also have enzymes that can hydrolyze plant starch</li>
        <li>Most of the glucose monomers in starch are joined by 1-4 linkages.</li>
        <li>amylose is the simplest form of starch and it is unbrached.</li>
        <li>a morre complex starch is amylopectin.it is a brached polymer with 1-6 linkages at the branch points</li>
        <li>animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen, a polymer of glucose that is like amylopectin but more extensively branched. More branches provide more free ends available for breakdown</li>
        <li>vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells. </li>
        <li>energy stored by carbohydrates can sustain a human for at most one day unless they are replenish by eating</li>
        <li>low carbohydrate diets can result in weakness and fatigue</li>

    </ul>
    <h7>Structural Polysaccharides:</h7>
    organisms build strong materials from structural polysaccharide. Like:
    <ol>
        <li><ul>cellulose. 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
            It is similar to starch.
            <li>it is a major component of the tough walls that enclose plant cells.</li>
            <li>it is the most abundant organic compound on earth.</li>
            </ul><br>

            plant cell wall is made of cellulose.
            in plant cell walls, cellulose grouped in this way are called microfibrils.
        <br>
       </p> <li>
            enzymes that digest starch by hydrolysing &alpha; linkage are unable to digest &beta linkages. thus we can not digest cellulose.
        </li><li>
            cellulose stimulates the lining of digestive tract to secrete mucus which helps in passage of food through the alimentary canal.</li>
        <li>
            cellulose in not a mutrient for humans but it is an impartant part of a healthy diet.</li>
        <li>
            most vegetables and fruits are rich in cellulose.

    <h3 style="color: rgb(79, 195, 238);">Proteins</h3><hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells.</li>
        <li>some proteins speed up chemical reactions, while others play a role in defense,storage, transport, cellular communication, movement, or structural support.</li>
        <li>Enzymatic proteins regylate metabolism by acting as catalysts.</li>
        <li>Enzymatic protiens can be thought of as workhorses as they can perform its functon over and over again.</li>
        <li>each type of protein having a unique three dimensional shape.</li>
        <li>Proteins are all constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids, linked in unbranched polymers.</li>
        <li>The bond between amino acids is called a peptide bond and a polymer of amino acids is called a polypeptide.</li>
        <li>A protein is a biologically functional molicule made up of one or more plypeptides, each folded and coiled into a specifec tree dimentional structure.</li>
            
    </ul>
    <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Amino acids (monomers)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>An amino acid is an organic molevule with both an amino group and a corboxyl group.</li>
        <li>At center of the amino acid there is an asymmetric carbon called &alpha; carbon.</li>
        <li>its ofur different partneres are an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group symbolized by R.</li>
        <li>The physical and chemical properties of the side chain determine the unique charateristics of a particular amino acid, thus affecting its functional role in a polypeptide.</li>
        <li>the amino acids are grouped accordint to the ptoperties of their side chains.</li>
        <li>One group consists of amino acids witih monpolar side chains, which are hydrophobic and another group consists of amino acids with polar side chains, which are hydrophilic.</li>
        <li>Acidic amino acids have -COOH in their side chain and basic amino acids have -NH<sub>2</sub> in their side chain.</li>
        <br>
        <strong>following is the list of 20 amino acids :</strong>

    </ul>
    <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Amino acids (monomers)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other, they can become joined by a dehydration reacton, with the removal of a water molevule. </li>
        <li>The resulting covalent vond is called a peptide bond></li>
        <li>The repeating sequence of atoms is called the polypeptide backbone. Extending from this backbone are the different side chains</li>
        <li>The end of polypeptide chain having free amino group is called N-terminal and the end having carboxyl group is called the C-terminal.</li>
        <li>cells can make many different polymers by linking a limited set of monomers into diverse sequences.</li>
        <li>The term polypeptide is not synonym with the term protein. Even for a protein consisting of a single polypeptide.</li>
        <li>A functional protien is not just a polypeptide chain, but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape.</li>
        <li>it is the amino acid sequince of each polypeptide that determines what three dimensional structure the protein will have under normal cellular conditions.</li>
        <li>Many proteins are roughly spherical, while others are shaped like fibres.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="color: rgb(178, 242, 51);"> Four levels of protein structures:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>In spite of their great diversity, proteins share three superimosed levels of structure, known as primary, secondary and tertiary structure.</li>
        <li>A fourth level, quarternary structure arises when a protien consists of two or more polypeptide chains.</li>

    <dl>
        <dt>Primary structure :</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>

                <li>Transthyretin is made up of four identical polypeptide chains, each composed of 127 amino acids.</li>
                <li>the precise primary structure of a protein is determined not by the random linking of amino acids, but by inherited genetic information.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Secondary Structure:</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Many proteins have segments of their polypeptide chains repeatedly cioled or folded in patterns that contribute to the protein's overall shape. These coils and folds, collectively referred to as secondary structure.</li>
                <li>these structures are formed by hydrogen bonds between the repeatingn constituents of the polypeptide backbone.</li>
                <li>within the backbone, the oxygen atoms have a partial negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogens gane a partial positive charge. So, hydrogen bods can be formed between these atoms</li>
                <li>these hydrogen bonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein.</li>
